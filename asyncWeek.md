# How to Approach Async Week:

Below are the topics to complete before Senior phase starts!

A few notes:

- It's best if you do the mandatory workshops _In order_. Each will build upon concepts
in the the previous topic.
- Our Project Boilerplate includes a playlist of videos to review ahead of Sr Phase: Testing, Deployment, and Security There are timestamps for each topic in the video description.

## üîé **Async Week Project** üí°

### **What?**
Absolutely anything you want it to be. This is meant to be ‚Äú_fun and playful_.‚Äù If what you deliver is incomplete, **that‚Äôs fine**! Think of this as a very low-stakes sandbox.

For some inspiration, check out this [list of technologies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aApC_9G1tG1q3LfCfliUPHrK7NF2d3K9_Wu4mPT9BpY/edit?usp=sharing) to explore.

### **When?**
It is **due by Friday at 1pm (EST) of Async Week**.

### **How?**
Record a **short** (`<= 5` minutes) screencast and upload to YouTube as an **unlisted** video.

Your video submission does ***not*** have to be polished. **At all.** You‚Äôre ***not*** expected to show this to anyone outside of this class. Just think of it as a casual class presentation. Keep it conversational.

On the due date, an instructor will start a thread within the cohort Slack channel.

Share the name of the technology you used, a quick description of what the technology is used for, and the link to your YouTube screencast.
- For example, Slack, "***D3.js - JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. [insert link here]***," which can foster a conversation amongst each other like so:
  - ‚ÄúWow I didn‚Äôt know you could do that with D3!‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúThanks, I really liked your Neo4J demonstration. How‚Äôd you get that graph to show up?‚Äù

### **Why?**
**To explore and have fun!** Seriously. This is an opportunity to goof off with **new technology** _without_ any specific expectations. You don‚Äôt have any requirements to fulfill or tests to pass. If your project is unfinished and totally broken, that‚Äôs **perfectly okay**. Just talk about what you learned.

**<details><summary>FAQ</summary>**

- ***Will the help desk be open?***
  - No, during Async Week the help desk is _not_ open.
- ***What if nothing works?!***
  - It's OK! No stress. In your video, just share things like _why you picked the technology_, _what challenges arose_, _what you learned from the experience_, etc.
- ***Can I reach out to anyone if I have a general question?***
  - Absolutely! Throw your question in the **cohort Slack channel** and the instructor(s) will respond when they can!

worry if you cannot get through it all.
